### What is computer programming?

*   The science and art of writing computer programs.
*   A computer program is a set of instructions that tell a computer what to do. 
    *   Examples: web browsers, office suites, video games, ATMs. 
    *   Also known as "code," written in a programming language. 


### What is a programming language?

*   A written language that tells computers what to do. 
*   Examples: Java, JavaScript, C, C++, C#, Objective-C, Visual Basic (VB), Python.


### Programming language syntax

*   The structure of statements in a computer programming language. 
*   Programming syntax is strict; errors will prevent the computer from understanding the code.


### What is Python?

*   A general-purpose programming language used for a wide variety of tasks. 
*   Used by organizations like Wikipedia, Google, Yahoo!, CERN, NASA, Facebook, Amazon, and Instagram. 
*   Popular for scientific computing, data science, machine learning/AI, and natural language processing. 
*   **Interpreted Language:** Code is translated and executed one statement at a time.
*   **Object-Oriented Programming:**  A powerful paradigm for developing reusable software. 

### HelloWorld.py

*   A simple program that displays "Hello, world!" on the screen. 
*   Illustrates the basic structure of a Python program.
*   Can be run from the command line or within an IDE 

### Installing Python

* Download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/)
* Consider using an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) like IDLE (comes with Python) or other options: Visual Studio Code, PyCharm. 

### Python Shell

* The Python shell allows you to interact with Python and run commands directly. 

### Saving Your Work

* Write your Python code in `.py` files to save your work. 

### Turtle Graphics

* A module in Python for creating graphics. 
* Uses simple commands to move a "turtle" on the screen and draw shapes. 
* Example: Drawing a square using `forward()` and `left()` commands.

### Variables

* Store values that can be used in your code. 
* Make your code more flexible and easier to change.
